Multiple models such as GMM, CNN, SVM were compared and CNN+LSTM outperformed with a greater accuracy. The above models were evaluated on the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset. The results highlight their potential for practical applications within speaker identification systems.
